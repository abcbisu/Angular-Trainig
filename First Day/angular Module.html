<!--An AngularJS module defines an application.
The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
The module is a container for the application controllers.
Controllers always belong to a module.

The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run.
Add a controller to your application, and refer to the controller with the ng-controller directive:
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application.-->
